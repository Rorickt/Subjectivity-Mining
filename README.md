# Subjectivity-Mining
The code for various assignments of this VU NLP course

# Files

In folder *Assignment 3* there are two files.
- `Transformer_fine-tune.ipynb` - contains the code to finetune a transformer model on either OLID or HASOC data. 
- `Alternate_classifierhead.ipynb`  - contains the code two extract the CLS embeddings from a transformer model and use those as input for a SVM classifier

Both jupyter notebooks do not require any other packages than those installed by the initial cells (when run on google collab).
